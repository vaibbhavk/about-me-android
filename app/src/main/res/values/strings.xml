    <string name="bio">A Lion lay asleep in the forest,
        \n\n\n\nhis great head resting on his paws. A timid little Mouse came upon him unexpectedly,
        \nand in her fright and haste to get away, ran across the Lion\'s nose. Roused from his nap,
        \nthe Lion laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill her.
        \n\n\n\n\n\n"Spare me!" begged the poor Mouse. "Please let me go and some day I will surely repay you."
        \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lion was much amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him. But he was generous and finally let the Mouse go.\n\n</string>
